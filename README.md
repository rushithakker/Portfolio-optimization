# Stock Portfolio Optimization

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to optimize a stock portfolio for potential maximum returns while mitigating risks. Through the analysis of daily returns and price adjustments of selected stocks, the project offers insights into the best weight distribution among the stocks to achieve a balance between return and risk.

## Data Sources:
The data used for this project consists of historical stock prices for three major companies:
- Apple Inc. (`AAPL.csv`)
- Amazon Inc. (`AMZN.csv`)
- Tesla Inc. (`TSLA.csv`)

Each dataset contains details like Date, Adjusted Close Price, and other stock-related metrics over a specific timeframe.

## Tools & Libraries:
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Used for data wrangling and exploratory analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Leveraged for creating various visualizations, such as line plots and histograms.
- **Numpy**: Employed for numerical operations and simulations.
- **Scipy**: Used for statistical computations, especially in risk assessment.

## Challenges & Solutions:
During the project, a few challenges were encountered:
1. **Data Quality**: Some datasets had missing values or discrepancies, which were cleaned and pre-processed using pandas.
2. **Optimization Logic**: Determining the best weights for each stock in the portfolio required running multiple simulations to determine the ideal balance. Using the Sharpe ratio as a metric, the project was able to identify portfolios with maximum returns for a given risk.
3. **Visualization**: Presenting the portfolio's daily returns, stock prices, and efficient frontier demanded intuitive visualizations. Matplotlib facilitated the creation of comprehensive graphs that clearly communicated the results.
